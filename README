Description:

The main service contains a Flask app allows users engage in financial management.
In essence, the app presents the user with the choice to enter a name of an item and its value;
in return, the app connects to the second service (a Redis database) and selects a random
alternative activity that is generally considered a healthy alternative, which is then
returned to the user.



Running the application:

The application is composed to two images that will run on Docker.
Please use the 'docker-compose.yml' file and pull the images from their
respective repositories by invoking 'docker-compose up' in the same directory as the
'docker-compose.yml' file.

The application will run on port 5000.  If you are running the instance on
your local machine, you may connect via 'localhost:5000'.  If you are running the application
on a virtual machine (such as Ubuntu 22.04 on Jetstream), you may connect by pointing your
web browser to the public ip address of the virtual machine at port 5000, like this:
<public-ip-address>:5000.
